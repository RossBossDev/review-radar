# Getting started

This page tracks the hands-on onboarding flow for connecting a running Review Radar instance to a Slack workspace and GitHub organization.

::: warning Early setup
Review Radar does not yet have hosted signup. The steps below assume you are running the backend yourself, either locally behind a public tunnel or on a deployed HTTPS URL.
:::

## Setup checklist

1. Run the backend with a public HTTPS base URL.
2. Create and install a GitHub App for the target organization.
3. Create and install a Slack App for the target workspace.
4. Link Slack users to GitHub logins with `/review-radar link <github-login>`.
5. Trigger pull request activity and verify attention items appear in Slack.

## 1. Run the backend

Review Radar needs a URL that GitHub and Slack can call. For local setup, start the API on port `3000` and expose it with a tunnel such as ngrok or Cloudflare Tunnel.

Use these callback URLs, replacing `<base-url>` with your public HTTPS URL:

| Integration area | URL |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub webhook | `<base-url>/webhooks/github` |
| Slack slash command | `<base-url>/slack/commands` |
| Slack events | `<base-url>/slack/events` |
| Slack interactivity | `<base-url>/slack/interactions` |
| Readiness check | `<base-url>/health/ready` |

Set `APP_BASE_URL=<base-url>` in `apps/backend/.env`.

Local bootstrap commands:

```bash
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
corepack enable
pnpm install
POSTGRES_PORT=5433 docker compose up -d postgres # use 5432 if it is free
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev
```

If you use a non-default Postgres port, update `DATABASE_URL` in `apps/backend/.env` to match it, for example `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/review-radar`.

## 2. Connect GitHub

Create a GitHub App in the organization account that owns the repositories Review Radar should watch.

Minimum current configuration:

- Webhook URL: `<base-url>/webhooks/github`
- Webhook secret: a strong random value saved as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Repository permissions:
  - Pull requests: read
  - Issues: read
  - Checks: read
  - Metadata: read (required by GitHub)
- Subscribe to events:
  - Pull request
  - Pull request review
  - Pull request review comment
  - Issue comment
  - Check run
  - Check suite

After creating the app, save these values in `apps/backend/.env`:

- `GITHUB_APP_ID`
- `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` from the generated private key file
- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

Install the app on the organization repositories you want Review Radar to monitor.

## 3. Connect Slack

Create a Slack App for the workspace where Review Radar should send personal inbox responses and reminders.

Minimum current configuration:

- Slash command: `/review-radar`
  - Request URL: `<base-url>/slack/commands`
- Event subscriptions:
  - Request URL: `<base-url>/slack/events`
  - Bot event: `app_home_opened`
- Interactivity:
  - Request URL: `<base-url>/slack/interactions`
- Bot token scopes:
  - `chat:write`
  - `commands`

After installing the Slack App, save these values in `apps/backend/.env`:

- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`

## 4. Link users

Each Slack user needs to link their Slack account to their GitHub login before personal inbox commands or direct-message delivery can target them:

```text
/review-radar link <github-login>
```

Useful commands:

```text
/review-radar inbox
/review-radar unlink
/review-radar help
```

## 5. Verify the first signal

Open or update a pull request in an installed repository, then create an event Review Radar understands, such as requesting a review, mentioning a GitHub user in a PR body or comment, submitting a review, or completing checks.

Then verify:

1. GitHub reports successful webhook deliveries to `/webhooks/github`.
2. The backend logs show the delivery was accepted.
3. The linked Slack user can run `/review-radar inbox` and see active attention items.
