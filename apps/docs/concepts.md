# Concepts

OpenToast uses a small product vocabulary for pull request attention and delivery.

## Attention Item

An attention item is something in a pull request that likely needs a person's focus. Examples may include a review request, a conversation that needs a response, a stale pull request waiting on someone, or another signal that review work is blocked.

The goal is not to mirror every GitHub notification. The goal is to identify actionable pull request attention.

## Personal Inbox

A personal inbox is the set of attention items currently relevant to one person.

OpenToast is designed around the idea that each developer needs a focused view of "what needs me now" rather than a shared wall of repository activity.

## Digest

A digest is a grouped summary of attention items delivered at a useful time.

Digests should help you scan your review queue, prioritize follow-up, and return to the pull requests that need movement without receiving a separate message for every small event.

## Reminder

A reminder is a targeted nudge for an attention item that still needs action.

Reminders are intended to be useful, not noisy. They should point to pull request work that risks being forgotten or delayed.

## Delivery

Delivery is how OpenToast sends digests and reminders to users.

The first product direction is Slack delivery, so OpenToast can surface pull request attention where teams already coordinate work.
